### Hi there — I'm Fonzi

Thanks for stopping by. I’m a **Software Engineer in Test** with a love for automation, minimalism, and shipping things that actually work.

Most of my time is spent writing automated tests using **Playwright**, and doing API testing with **RestSharp**, **Postman**, or **Newman** — basically any OOP-friendly tool that gets the job done.

Lately, I’ve also been diving deeper into **DevOps**, infrastructure, and the pipeline life.

### What I'm Into

I love tech — even though I think most of it is bloat.  
That’s why I challenged myself to build a minimalist website using **only HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript).  
You can check it out here → [fonzi.xyz](https://fonzi.xyz)

Also, if you're privacy-minded, I run my own [Searx instance](https://searx.fonzi.xyz) —  
no logs, no tracking, no gimmicks.

### Things I’m Working On / Learning

- Currently learning **C** and **Python**  
  > (Python’s awful. I’m doing it anyway.)
- Working toward a self-built stack:  
  `Assembly → C → Python`
- Looking to **collaborate on FOSS** projects where I can bring my QA/DevOps skills to the table
- Trying to get better at **Assembly**  
  > (Built a Pascal → MIPS compiler once. It was rough. My code’s public — feel free to laugh.)
