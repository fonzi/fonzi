### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. I'm Fonzi. I'm a software engineer in test. I do mostly automated testing with Selenium and API testing with RestSharp (or any other OOP library) or Postman and Newman. 
Also I've done a lot of work in the DevOps realm lately. 

I love technology although I think it's bloat. Well most of it. 
Recently I took a challenge to write a minimalist website with just HTML and CSS no JavaScript. 
You can find that here Go to [fonzi.xyz](https://fonzi.xyz)
Or if you fancy to use a private search engine go to my [Searx](https://searx.fonzi.xyz) instance. I collect no logs. I promise. 

- I'm also currently working on docker with old windows technology (yuck ðŸ¤¢) for my day job. 
- I'm currently learning C and Python. I would like to go down the path of assembly and have a full stack of 
`Assembly -> C -> Python` all built on top of each other in that order. 
- I'm looking for collaborate on any FOSS projects that need help and could use my skill set. 
- I'm looking for help with learning Assembly. Most I've done is MIPS and a compiler from Pascal to MIPS it was
terrible. You can laugh at my code it's public. ðŸ˜…
- Ask me about software testing and automation. 
- How to reach me: fonzi@fonzi.xyz

Thanks for reading!
